# Guide to Assassination Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Assassination Rogue in 7.2.5. If you're looking for a
good introduction to playing Assassination in Legion, you've come to the right
place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Friday 16th June 2017 - Poison Bombing the meters**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 7.2.5 when
things are discovered and hot fixes happen. I also did not include any specific
opener for tier 19 and Mantle as people have not really settled on one and you
will be wanting to wear tier 20 as soon as possible anways.

## Introduction

Assassination is seen as the go to easy mode spec among all classes. This is due
to the low entry level and fairly straight forward rotation. We pack a lot of
single target damage with our selection of short cool downs. In addition to our
single target we have some relative cleave potential with our DoT orientated kit
and massive AoE burst when luck is on your side. Assassination has been the go
to spec for raiding for the majority of Legion due to its accessibility and
relative power level in comparison to the other two specs.

## Talents

Assassination talents are in great flux at the moment. There are a lot of
different combinations yielding results close to each other. You may choose one
over another based on preference or simulation result if you are looking to
gain the maximum out of your character.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Tier 19 (4 Piece)

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning
- Level 30: Nightstalker
- Level 45: Deeper Stratagem or Vigor
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Venom Rush

### Tier 20 (4 Piece)

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning
- Level 30: Subterfuge
- Level 45: Deeper Stratagem or Vigor
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Venom Rush

## Artifact

Our artifact are the Kingslayers. The ultimate lore weapons of the deadly half
breed assassin Garona.

### Traits

At this point in the expansion, a lot of characters will be at 40 artifact
knowledge or at least close to it. So filling out traits is fairly quick, and
you'll have all the golden traits easily.

If you do require the routes you should take, you can follow these routes in
order.

- Toxic Blades
- Urge to Kill
- Gushing Wound
- Blood of the Assassinated
- Master Alchemist
- Bag of Tricks
- Balanced Blades
- Poison Knives
- Surge of Toxins
- Serrated Edge
- From the Shadows
- Shadow Swiftness
- Shadow Walker
- Fade into Shadows
- Slayer's Precision

Then you want to get Legionblade, and once you've empowered your artifact you
can unlock the new traits.

- Silence of the Uncrowned
- Strangler
- Dense Concoction
- Sinister Circulation

Once you've got the 4th gold trait you can fill out 4/4 in the other powerful
traits.

- Master Assassin
- Master Alchemist
- Toxic Blades
- Gushing Wound
- Balanced Blades
- Serrated Edge
- Poison Knives

Then 4/4 in the less useful traits

- Shadow Walker
- Fade into Shadows

Then finally.

- Concordance of the Legionfall

### Relics

- Master Assassin
- Master Alchemist
- Toxic Blades
- Gushing Wound
- Strangler
- Balanced Blades
- Serrated Edge

You should always run a simulation of your character to check if a higher item
level relic might be better than your current relic. These aren't one-size fits
all results.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Legion has become a lot more complicated in the sense that warforged,
titanforged, and sockets make picking your best items more difficult, even if
they're a lower item level.

When in doubt, you should run simulations of your character to compare the item
or multiple items.

You may also be familiar with the term **stat weights**, this term is complete
bullshit. For a start it's **scale factors**, and secondly your scale factors
will become out of date whenever you equip a new item. It's always better to run
a simulation of your character to compare items to see if it's an upgrade. This
excludes trinkets as some times they're not modelled correctly in simulations.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

- Agility
- Mastery
- Critical Strike
- Versatility
- Haste

Certain items may change which stats you will want. For example Mantle of the
Master Assassin will bring Versatility ahead of Critical Strike.

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Potion of the Old War, or if you're saving gold
Potion of Prolonged Power (which is also best on AoE as well).

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Seventh Demon.

### TB on cool down, really?

Patch is still very new and so is the research put into it. According to preliminary
simulations it is best used on cool down.
