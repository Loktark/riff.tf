# Guide to Outlaw Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Outlaw Rogue in 7.2. If you're looking for a good
introduction to playing Outlaw in Legion, you've come to the right place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

## Introduction

Outlaw got a pretty big overhaul for Legion. The biggest change being the theme
of the spec. It was renamed from Combat to Outlaw and now packs proper slashing
and firing your pistol. Outlaw is the Rogue's go to spec when it comes to proper
close up cleaving. It does have its moments with single target but it really
shines when you have a lot of enemies surrounding you. When it comes to numbers
Outlaw has been on the back foot outside lucky rolls in raiding or running 5
mans.

## Talents

Outlaw talents are mostly cookie cutter except for the level 90 talents, and
the utility talents at level 60 and 75.

- Level 15: Ghostly Strike or Quick Draw<sup>1</sup>
- Level 30: Optional or Hit and Run<sup>2</sup>
- Level 45: Deeper Stratagem
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Alacrity
- Level 100: Marked for Death

1: Quick Draw becomes the go to talent as soon as you obtain the Greenskin's
Waterlogged Wristcuffs due to the synergy between the two.
2: Hit and Run becomes the best talent in this row if you have Thraxi's Tricky
Treads, due to movement speed becoming a damage increase.

## Artifact

Our artifact are The Dreadblades. These are the famous cursed sabres of the
fierce Outlaw that dared with the twisting nether.

### Traits

At this point in the expansion, a lot of characters will be at 25 artifact
knowledge or at least close to it. So filling out 34 traits is fairly quick, and
you'll have the 3 golden traits easily.

If you do require the routes you should take, you can follow these routes in
order.

- Fate's Thirst
- Fatebringer
- Ghostly Shell
- Greed
- Hidden Blade
- Gunslinger
- Deception
- Fortune's Boon
- Fortune's Strike
- Blunderbuss
- Blademaster
- Black Powder
- Blurred Time
- Fortune Strikes
- Blade Dancer

Then you want to get Cursed Steel, and once you've empowered your artifact you
can unlock the new traits.

- Bravado of the Uncrowned
- Sabermetrics
- Dreadblade's Vigor
- Loaded Dice

Once you've got the 4th gold trait you can fill out 4/4 in the other powerful
traits.

- Fate's Thirst
- Fortune's Boon
- Fortune Strikes
- Fortune's Strike
- Fatebringer
- Black Powder
- Gunslinger
- Blade Dancer

Then 4/4 in the less useful traits

- Ghostly Shell

### Relics

- Fate's Thirst
- Fortune's Boon
- Fortune Strikes
- Fortune's Strike
- Fatebringer
- Black Powder
- Gunslinger
- Blade Dancer

You should always run a simulation of your character to check if a higher item
level relic might be better than your current relic.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Legion has become a lot more complicated in the sense that warforged,
titanforged, and sockets make picking your best items more difficult, even if
they're a lower item level.

When in doubt, you should run simulations of your character to compare the item
or multiple items.

You may also be familiar with the term **stat weights**, this term is complete
bullshit. For a start it's **scale factors**, and secondly your scale factors
will become out of date whenever you equip a new item. It's always better to run
a simulation of your character to compare items to see if it's an upgrade. This
excludes trinkets as some times they're not modelled correctly in simulations.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

- Agility
- Versatility
- Haste
- Critical Strike
- Mastery

Certain items may change which stats you will want. For example Mantle of the
Master Assassin will make Critical Strike Chance less important.

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Potion of the Prolonged Power in all situations.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Seventh Demon.

#### Legendaries

- Mantle of the Master Assassin
- Greenskin's Waterlogged Wristcuffs
- Thraxi's Tricksy Treads
- Insignia of Ravenholdt
- Cinidaria, the Symbiote
- Shivarran Symmetry

## Rotation

### Pre-Pull

- 18 seconds on the pull timer, Marked for Death

### Priorities

- Between the Eyes, if you have 100% Critical Strike or need to proc Greenskin's
Waterlogged Wristcuffs.<sup>3</sup>
- Run Through

3: More details about this can be found in the
[FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions).

- Use on cool down
- You have less than 2 combo points and plenty energy

#### Adrenaline Rush

- Use on cool down

#### Vanish

- Use on cool down
- You have 6 combo points

#### Marked for Death

- Use on cool down unless you can quickly reset it via a dying mob.

### Cleave

- Toggle Blade Flurry on, and continue normal rotation.

## AddOns &amp; Macros

There isn't really any hard requirements for AddOns you should use. You should
look into using Weak Auras and/or an energy bar AddOn.

### Weak Auras

You can find a number of Weak Auras available on [wago.io](https://wago.io).
Below are links to a set of Rogue Weak Auras.

- Cool Downs [https://wago.io/4ycVDEaP-](https://wago.io/4ycVDEaP-)

A really handy weak aura for tracking Blunderbuss proc

- Blunderbuss/Debuffs [https://wago.io/VJhMnPWWG](https://wago.io/VJhMnPWWG)

### Macros

There are not any required Outlaw macros. A generally accepted beneficial one
is the mouseover Marked for Death macro. It's useful if a ranged target is about
to die, and you want the Combo points and the reset.

Mouse over Marked for Death:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Greenskin's Waterlogged Wristcuffs

When you acquire Greenskin's, you want to use Between the Eyes, when you have
a Blunderbuss proc or when you have 100% critical strike due to Mantle of the
Master Assassin.

### Thraxi's Tricksy Treads

When you acquire Traxi's Tricky Treads, you want to use Sprint as an offensive
cool down, if the encounter allows for it, For example you don't need to use
your Sprint for utility purposes, until it is off cool down again.

### True Bearing

As horrible as it may sound, yes you only want True Bearing. This buff is so
powerful when combined with Outlaw's top legendaries Mantle of the Master
Assassin and Greenskin's Waterlogged Wristcuffs. So as long as you will have use
for the whole duration of the new Roll the Bones, or there isn't an instance
where you need to deal immediate damage to lets say an add or a boss shield, you
want to keep re-rolling until you have True Bearing.

### Pistol Shot

Using Pistol Shot at the right times, can prove to be quite difficult,
especially if you are in the so-called Adrenaline Rush feedback Loop, because it
will result in energy-capping. If you estimate that a free use of Pistol Shot
will cause you to cap energy at any one point (unless you have a Blunderbuss
proc empowered with Greenskin's) you should instead use Saberslash.
