# Guide to Subtlety Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Subtlety Rogue in 8.0. If you're looking for a good
introduction to playing Subtlety in Battle for Azeroth, you've come to the right
place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Saturday, 21st July 2018 - The most secret of techniques**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 8.0 when
things are discovered, hot fixes happen and balance is under way.

<div id="toc"></div>

## Introduction

Subtlety is largely the same as it was in legion. The spec mainly lost some speed
along the artifact weapon. It still offers great ability to feed multiple enemies
into a priority target. 

## Talents

Subtlety talents focus on two builds depending on the amount of targets.
More dancing for single target and more impactful dancing for AoE.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Single Target

- Level 15: Find Weakness
- Level 30: Shadow Focus
- Level 45: Marked for Death
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Enveloping Shadows
- Level 100: Master of Shadows

### Multi Target

- Level 15: Find Weakness
- Level 30: Shadow Focus
- Level 45: Deeper Stratagem
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Dark Shadow
- Level 100: Secret Technique

You should always run a simulation of your character to check which talents are
best for you.

### Traits

Under construction.

Rough order.

### Single Target

- Twist the Knife: Envenom deals additional damage per combo point, and Envenom lasts for 1 sec longer when it critically strikes.
- Contaminant: Mutilate has a 10% chance to apply additional Deadly Poison, and does additional damage.
- Double Dose: When Mutilate applies Lethal poison with both daggers, it poisons the target for an additional damage.
- Poisoned Wire: Garrote increases the critical strike rating of your next Mutilate.
- Shrouded Suffocation: Garrote cast from Stealth generates 2 additional Combo Points and deals additional damage.
- Scent of Blood: Rupture increases your Agility. You may gain this benefit for each enemy suffering from your Rupture.
- Fan of Blades: Fan of Knives' radius is increased to 15 yds and damage is increased if it hits at least 3 targets.

### Multi Target

- Fan of Blades: Fan of Knives' radius is increased to 15 yds and damage is increased if it hits at least 3 targets.
- Scent of Blood: Rupture increases your Agility. You may gain this benefit for each enemy suffering from your Rupture.
- Shrouded Suffocation: Garrote cast from Stealth generates 2 additional Combo Points and deals additional damage.
- Twist the Knife: Envenom deals ad

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth has been moved into "Item level is king".
We still have our prefered stats, but a higher item level item should beat a
lower item level most of the time.

When in doubt, you should run simulations of your character to compare the item
or multiple items.

You may also be familiar with the term **stat weights**, this term is complete
bullshit. For a start it's **scale factors**, and secondly your scale factors
will become out of date whenever you equip a new item. It's always better to run
a simulation of your character to compare items to see if it's an upgrade. This
excludes trinkets as some times they're not modelled correctly in simulations.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

### Single Target

- Agility
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Haste
- Versatility

### Multi Target

- Agility
- Mastery
- Critical Strike
- Versatility
- Haste 

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Battle Potion of Agility.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Currents.

## AddOns &amp; Macros

There isn't really any hard requirements for AddOns you should use. You should
look into using Weak Auras and/or an energy bar AddOn.

### Weak Auras

You can find a number of Weak Auras available on [wago.io](https://wago.io).

### Macros

There are a number of macros to help with Shadow Dance and abilities used with
