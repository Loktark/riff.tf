# Guide to Assassination Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Assassination Rogue in 8.0. If you're looking for a
good introduction to playing Assassination in Battle for Azeroth, you've come
to the right place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Friday 21st July 2018 - Poison Bombing no more**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 8.0 when
things are discovered, hot fixes happen and balance is under way.

## Introduction

Assassination is seen as the go to easy mode spec among all classes. This is
due to the low entry level and fairly straight forward rotation. We pack a lot
of single target damage with our basic tool kit. In addition to our single target
we have some consistent cleave potential with our DoT orientated kit and talents
to support that. Assassination still remains a lot of its similarities from
legion due to minimal changes moving from expansion to expansion.

## Talents

Assassination talents are greatly situational and can be swapped a lot. There
are a lot of different combinations yielding results close to each other.
You may choose one over another based on preference, simulation result or
a different encounter you are facing.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Single Target

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning or Blindside
- Level 30: Nightstalker or Subterfuge or Master Assassin
- Level 45: Vigor
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Poison Bomb

### Multi Target

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning
- Level 30: Nightstalker or Subterfuge
- Level 45: Vigor or Marked for Death
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Criomson Tempest

### Traits

Under construction.

Rough order.

### Single Target

- Twist the Knife: Envenom deals additional damage per combo point, and Envenom lasts for 1 sec longer when it critically strikes.
- Contaminant: Mutilate has a 10% chance to apply additional Deadly Poison, and does additional damage.
- Double Dose: When Mutilate applies Lethal poison with both daggers, it poisons the target for an additional damage.
- Poisoned Wire: Garrote increases the critical strike rating of your next Mutilate.
- Shrouded Suffocation: Garrote cast from Stealth generates 2 additional Combo Points and deals additional damage.
- Scent of Blood: Rupture increases your Agility. You may gain this benefit for each enemy suffering from your Rupture.
- Fan of Blades: Fan of Knives' radius is increased to 15 yds and damage is increased if it hits at least 3 targets.

### Multi Target

- Double Dose: When Mutilate applies Lethal poison with both daggers, it poisons the target for an additional damage.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth has been moved into "Item level is king".
We still have our prefered stats, but a higher item level item should beat a
lower item level most of the time.

When in doubt, you should run simulations of your character to compare the item
or multiple items.

You may also be familiar with the term **stat weights**, this term is complete
bullshit. For a start it's **scale factors**, and secondly your scale factors
will become out of date whenever you equip a new item. It's always better to run
a simulation of your character to compare items to see if it's an upgrade. This
excludes trinkets as some times they're not modelled correctly in simulations.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

### Single Target

- Agility
- Haste
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Versatility

### Multi Target

- Agility
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Versatility
- Haste

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Battle Potion of Agility.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Currents.
